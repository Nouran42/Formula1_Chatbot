The FIA Formula One World Championship has been one of the world's premier forms of motorsport since its inaugural running in 1950 and is often considered to be the pinnacle of motorsport. The word formula in the name refers to the set of rules all participant cars must follow. A Formula One season consists of a series of races, known as Grands Prix. Grands Prix take place in multiple countries and continents on either purpose-built circuits or closed roads.\nA points scoring system is used at Grands Prix to determine two annual World Championships: one for the drivers, and one for the constructors—now synonymous with teams. Each driver must hold a valid Super Licence, the highest class of racing licence the FIA issues, and the races must be held on Grade One tracks, the highest grade rating the FIA issues for tracks.\nFormula One cars are the world's fastest regulated road-course racing cars, owing to high cornering speeds achieved by generating large amounts of aerodynamic downforce, most of which is generated by front and rear wings, as well as underbody tunnels. The cars depend on electronics, aerodynamics, suspension, and tyres. Traction control, launch control, automatic shifting, and other electronic driving aids were first banned in 1994. They were briefly reintroduced in 2001, and have more recently been banned since 2004 and 2008, respectively.[1]\nWith the average annual cost of running a team—e.g. designing, building, and maintaining cars; staff payroll; transport—at approximately £220 million,[2] Formula One's financial and political battles are widely reported. The Formula One Group is owned by Liberty Media, which acquired it in 2017 from private-equity firm CVC Capital Partners for US$8 billion.[3][4] The United Kingdom is the hub of Formula One racing with six out of the ten teams based there.[5][6]\nHistory[edit]\nMain article: History of Formula One\nFormula One originated from the World Manufacturers' Championship (1925–1930) and European Drivers' Championship (1931–1939). The formula is a set of rules that all participants' cars must follow. Formula One was a formula agreed upon in 1946 to officially become effective in 1947. The first Grand Prix in accordance with the new regulations was the 1946 Turin Grand Prix, anticipating the formula's official start.[7][8] Before World War II, a number of Grand Prix racing organisations made suggestions for a new championship to replace the European Championship, but due to the suspension of racing during the conflict, the new International Formula for cars did not become formalised until 1946, to become effective in 1947. The new World Championship was instituted to commence in 1950.[9]\nThe first world championship race, the 1950 British Grand Prix, took place at Silverstone Circuit in the United Kingdom on 13 May 1950.[10] Giuseppe Farina, competing for Alfa Romeo, won the first Drivers' World Championship, narrowly defeating his teammate Juan Manuel Fangio. Fangio won the championship in 1951, 1954, 1955, 1956, and 1957.[11] This set the record for the most World Championships won by a single driver, a record that stood for 46 years until Michael Schumacher won his sixth championship in 2003.[11]\nJuan Manuel Fangio's 1951 title-winning Alfa Romeo 159\nA Constructors' Championship was added in the 1958 season. Stirling Moss, despite often being regarded as one of the greatest Formula One drivers in the 1950s and 1960s, never won the Formula One championship.[12] Between 1955 and 1961, Moss finished second in the championship four times and third the other three times.[13][14] Fangio won 24 of the 52 races he entered—still the record for the highest Formula One winning percentage by an individual driver.[15] National championships existed in South Africa and the UK in the 1960s and 1970s. Promoters held non-championship Formula One events for many years. Due to the increasing cost of competition, the last of these was held in 1983.[16][17]\nThis era featured teams managed by road-car manufacturers, such as Alfa Romeo, Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz and Maserati. The first seasons featured prewar cars like Alfa Romeo's 158, which were front-engined, with narrow tyres and 1.5-litre supercharged or 4.5-litre naturally aspirated engines. The 1952 and 1953 seasons were run to Formula Two regulations, for smaller, less powerful cars, due to concerns over the dearth of Formula One cars.[18][19] When a new Formula One formula for engines limited to 2.5 litres was reinstated for the 1954 world championship, Mercedes-Benz introduced its W196, which featured things never seen on Formula One cars before, such as desmodromic valves, fuel injection, and enclosed streamlined bodywork. Mercedes drivers won the championship for the next two years, before the team withdrew from all motorsport competitions due to the 1955 Le Mans disaster.[20][21]\nTechnological developments[edit]\nStirling Moss's Lotus 18 at the Nürburgring during 1961\nThe first major technological development in the sport was Bugatti's introduction of mid-engined cars. Jack Brabham, the world champion in 1959, 1960, and 1966, soon proved the mid-engine's superiority over all other engine positions. By 1961 all teams had switched to mid-engined cars. The Ferguson P99, a four-wheel drive design, was the last front-engined Formula One car to enter a world championship race. It entered the 1961 British Grand Prix, the only front-engined car to compete that year.[22]\nDuring 1962, Lotus introduced a car with an aluminium-sheet monocoque chassis instead of the traditional space-frame design. This proved to be the greatest technological breakthrough since the introduction of mid-engined cars.\nIn 1968, sponsorship was introduced to the sport. Team Gunston became the first team to run cigarette sponsorship on its Brabham cars, which privately entered in orange, brown and gold colours of Gunston cigarettes in the 1968 South African Grand Prix on 1 January 1968.[23] Five months later, the first works team, Lotus, initially using the British racing green, followed this example when it entered its cars painted in the red, gold, and white colours of the Imperial Tobacco's Gold Leaf livery at the 1968 Spanish Grand Prix.\nAerodynamic downforce slowly gained importance in car design with the appearance of aerofoils during the 1968 season. The wings were introduced by Lotus's owner Colin Chapman who installed modest front wings and a rear spoiler on his Lotus 49B at the 1968 Monaco Grand Prix. In the late 1970s, Lotus introduced ground-effect aerodynamics, previously used on Jim Hall's Chaparral 2J in 1970, that provided enormous downforce and greatly increased cornering speeds. The aerodynamic forces pressing the cars to the track were up to five times the car's weight. As a result, extremely stiff springs were needed to maintain a constant ride height, leaving the suspension virtually solid. This meant that the drivers depended entirely on the tyres for any small amount of cushioning of the car and driver from irregularities of the road surface.[24]\nBig business[edit]\nBeginning in the 1970s, Bernie Ecclestone rearranged the management of Formula One's commercial rights; he is widely credited with transforming the sport into the multi-billion dollar business it now is.[25][26] When Ecclestone bought the Brabham team during 1971, he gained a seat on the Formula One Constructors' Association, and in 1978, he became its president.[27] Previously, the circuit owners controlled the income of the teams and negotiated with each individually; Ecclestone persuaded the teams to \"hunt as a pack\" through FOCA.[26] He offered Formula One to circuit owners as a package they could take or leave. In return for the package, almost all that was required was to surrender trackside advertising.[25]\nThe formation of the Fédération Internationale du Sport Automobile (FISA) in 1979 set off the FISA–FOCA war, during which FISA and its president Jean-Marie Balestre argued repeatedly with FOCA over television revenues and technical regulations.[28] The Guardian said that Ecclestone and Max Mosley \"used [FOCA] to wage a guerrilla war with a very long-term aim in view\". FOCA threatened to establish a rival series and boycotted a Grand Prix, and FISA withdrew its sanction from races.[25] The result was the 1981 Concorde Agreement, which guaranteed technical stability, as teams were to be given reasonable notice of new regulations.[29] Although FISA asserted its right to the TV revenues, it gave FOCA the administration of those rights.[30]\nFISA imposed a ban on ground-effect aerodynamics during 1983.[31] But by then, turbocharged engines, which Renault had pioneered in 1977, were producing over 520 kW (700 bhp) and were essential to be competitive. By 1986, a BMW turbocharged engine achieved a flash reading of 5.5 bar (80 psi) pressure, estimated[who?] to be over 970 kW (1,300 bhp) in qualifying for the Italian Grand Prix. The next year, power in race trim reached around 820 kW (1,100 bhp), with boost pressure limited to only 4.0 bar.[32] These cars were the most powerful open-wheel circuit racing cars ever. To reduce engine power output and thus speeds, the FIA limited fuel tank capacity in 1984, and boost pressures in 1988, before banning turbocharged engines completely in 1989.[33]\nThe development of electronic driver aids began in the 1980s. Lotus began to develop a system of active suspension, which first appeared during 1983 on the Lotus 92.[34] By 1987, this system had been perfected and was driven to victory by Ayrton Senna in the Monaco Grand Prix that year. In the early 1990s, other teams followed suit and semi-automatic gearboxes and traction control were a natural progression. The FIA, due to complaints that technology was determining races' outcomes more than driver skill, banned many such aids for the 1994 season. This resulted in cars that previously depended on electronic aids becoming very \"twitchy\" and difficult to drive. Observers felt the ban on driver aids was in name only, as they \"proved difficult to police effectively\".[35]\nThe teams signed a second Concorde Agreement in 1992 and a third in 1997.[36]\nStefan Johansson driving for Ferrari at the 1985 European Grand Prix\nOn the track, the McLaren and Williams teams dominated the 1980s and 1990s. Brabham was also competitive during the early 1980s, winning two Drivers' Championships with Nelson Piquet. Powered by Porsche, Honda, and Mercedes-Benz, McLaren won 16 championships (seven constructors' and nine drivers') in that period, while Williams used engines from Ford, Honda, and Renault to also win 16 titles (nine constructors' and seven drivers'). The rivalry between racers Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost became F1's central focus during 1988 and continued until Prost retired at the end of 1993. Senna died at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix after crashing into a wall on the exit of the notorious curve Tamburello. The FIA worked to improve the sport's safety standards since that weekend, during which Roland Ratzenberger also died in an accident during Saturday qualifying. No driver died of injuries sustained on the track at the wheel of a Formula One car for 20 years until the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix, where Jules Bianchi collided with a recovery vehicle after aquaplaning off the circuit, dying nine months later from his injuries. Since 1994, three track marshals have died, one at the 2000 Italian Grand Prix,[37] one at the 2001 Australian Grand Prix[37] and one at the 2013 Canadian Grand Prix.\nSince Senna's and Ratzenberger's deaths, the FIA has used safety as a reason to impose rule changes that otherwise, under the Concorde Agreement, would have had to be agreed upon by all the teams—most notably the changes introduced for 1998. This so-called 'narrow track' era resulted in cars with smaller rear tyres, a narrower track overall, and the introduction of grooved tyres to reduce mechanical grip. The objective was to reduce cornering speeds and produce racing similar to rainy conditions by enforcing a smaller contact patch between tyre and track. According to the FIA, this was to reduce cornering speeds in the interest of safety.[38]\nDamon Hill driving for Williams at the 1995 Canadian Grand Prix\nResults were mixed, as the lack of mechanical grip resulted in the more ingenious designers clawing back the deficit with aerodynamic grip. This resulted in pushing more force onto the tyres through wings and aerodynamic devices, which in turn resulted in less overtaking, as these devices tended to make the wake behind the car turbulent or 'dirty'. This prevented other cars from following closely due to their dependence on 'clean' air to make the car stick to the track. The grooved tyres also had the unfortunate side effect of initially being of a harder compound to be able to hold the grooved tread blocks, which resulted in spectacular accidents in times of aerodynamic grip failure, as the harder compound could not grip the track as well.\nDrivers from McLaren, Williams, Renault (formerly Benetton), and Ferrari, dubbed the \"Big Four\", won every World Championship from 1984 to 2008. The teams won every Constructors' Championship from 1979 to 2008, as well as placing themselves as the top four teams in the Constructors' Championship in every season between 1989 and 1997, and winning every race but one (the 1996 Monaco Grand Prix) between 1988 and 1997. Due to the technological advances of the 1990s, the cost of competing in Formula One increased dramatically, thus increasing financial burdens. This, combined with the dominance of four teams (largely funded by big car manufacturers such as Mercedes-Benz), caused the poorer independent teams to struggle not only to remain competitive but to stay in business. This effectively forced several teams to withdraw.\nManufacturers' return[edit]\nMichael Schumacher (pictured here in 2001) won five consecutive titles with Ferrari. Michael Schumacher and Ferrari won five consecutive Drivers' Championships (2000–2004) and six consecutive Constructors' Championships (1999–2004). Schumacher set many new records, including those for Grand Prix wins (91, since beaten by Lewis Hamilton), wins in a season (13, since beaten by Max Verstappen), and most Drivers' Championships (seven, tied with Lewis Hamilton as of 2025).[39] Schumacher's championship streak ended on 25 September 2005, when Renault driver Fernando Alonso became Formula One's youngest champion at that time (until Lewis Hamilton in 2008 and followed by Sebastian Vettel in 2010). During 2006, Renault and Alonso won both titles again. Schumacher retired at the end of 2006 after 16 years in Formula One, but came out of retirement for the 2010 season, racing for the newly formed Mercedes works team, following the rebrand of Brawn GP.\nDuring this period, FIA frequently changed the championship rules with the intention of improving the on-track action and cutting costs.[40] Team orders, legal since the championship started during 1950, were banned during 2002, after several incidents in which teams openly manipulated race results, generating negative publicity, most famously by Ferrari at the 2002 Austrian Grand Prix. Other changes included the qualifying format, the point-scoring system, the technical regulations, and rules specifying how long engines and tyres must last. A 'tyre war' between suppliers Michelin and Bridgestone saw lap times fall, although, at the 2005 United States Grand Prix at Indianapolis, seven out of ten teams did not race when their Michelin tyres were deemed unsafe for use, leading to Bridgestone becoming the sole tyre supplier to Formula One for the 2007 season by default. On 20 December 2007 Bridgestone signed a contract that officially made it the exclusive tyre supplier for the next three seasons.[41]\nDuring 2006, Max Mosley outlined a 'green' future for Formula One, in which efficient use of energy would be an important factor.[42]\nStarting in 2000, with Ford's purchase of Stewart Grand Prix to form the Jaguar Racing team, new manufacturer-owned teams entered Formula One for the first time since Alfa Romeo's and Renault's departures in 1985. By 2006, the manufacturer teams—Renault, BMW, Toyota, Honda, and Ferrari—dominated the championship, taking five of the first six places in the Constructors' Championship. The exception was McLaren, which at the time was part-owned by Mercedes-Benz. Through the Grand Prix Manufacturers Association (GPMA), the manufacturers negotiated a larger share of Formula One's commercial profit and a greater say in the running of the sport.[43]\nManufacturers' decline and return of the privateers[edit]\nThe three teams that debuted in 2010 all disappeared within seven years of their debuts. From top: 2012 HRT (originally Hispania Racing); 2014 Caterham (originally Team Lotus); 2016 Manor (originally Virgin Racing).\nIn 2008 and 2009, Honda, BMW, and Toyota all withdrew from Formula One racing within a year, blaming the economic recession. This resulted in the end of manufacturer dominance of the sport. The Honda F1 team went through a management buyout to become Brawn GP, with Ross Brawn and Nick Fry running and owning the majority of the organisation. Brawn GP laid off hundreds of employees, but won the year's world championships. BMW F1 was bought out by the original founder of the team, Peter Sauber. The Lotus F1 Team[44] was another, formerly manufacturer-owned team that reverted to \"privateer\" ownership, together with the buy-out of the Renault team by Genii Capital investors. But a link with its previous owners still survived, with its car continuing to be powered by a Renault engine until 2014.\nMcLaren also announced that it was to reacquire the shares in its team from Mercedes-Benz (McLaren's partnership with Mercedes was reported to have started to sour with the McLaren Mercedes SLR road car project and tough F1 championships, which included McLaren being found guilty of spying on Ferrari). Hence, during the 2010 season, Mercedes-Benz re-entered the sport as a manufacturer after it purchased Brawn GP and split with McLaren after 15 seasons with the team.\nDuring the 2009 season, Formula One was gripped by the FIA–FOTA dispute. FIA President Max Mosley proposed numerous cost-cutting measures for the next season, including an optional budget cap for the teams;[45] teams electing to take the budget cap would be granted greater technical freedom, adjustable front and rear wings, and an engine not subject to a rev limiter.[45] The Formula One Teams Association (FOTA) believed that allowing some teams to have such technical freedom would have created a 'two-tier' championship, and thus requested urgent talks with the FIA. But talks broke down and FOTA teams announced, with the exception of Williams and Force India,[46][47] that 'they had no choice' but to form a breakaway championship series.[47]\nBernie Ecclestone, the former Chief executive of the Formula One Group\nOn 24 June, Formula One's governing body and the teams reached an agreement to prevent a breakaway series. It was agreed teams must cut spending to the level of the early 1990s within two years; exact figures were not specified, and Max Mosley agreed he would not stand for reelection to the FIA presidency in October.[48] Following further disagreements, after Mosley suggested he would stand for reelection,[49] FOTA made it clear that breakaway plans were still being pursued. On 8 July, FOTA issued a press release stating it had been informed it was not entered for the 2010 season,[50] and an FIA press release said the FOTA representatives had walked out of the meeting.[51] On 1 August, it was announced FIA and FOTA had signed a new Concorde Agreement, bringing an end to the crisis and securing the sport's future until 2012.[52]\nTo compensate for the loss of manufacturer teams, four new teams were accepted entry into the 2010 season ahead of a much anticipated 'cost-cap'. Entrants included a reborn Team Lotus—led by a Malaysian consortium including Tony Fernandes, the boss of Air Asia; Hispania Racing—the first Spanish Formula One team; and Virgin Racing—Richard Branson's entry into the series following a successful partnership with Brawn the year before. They were also joined by the US F1 Team, which planned to run out of the United States as the only non-European-based team in the sport. Financial issues befell the squad before they even made the grid. Despite the entry of these new teams, the proposed cost-cap was repealed and these teams—which did not have the budgets of the midfield and top-order teams—ran around at the back of the field until they collapsed; HRT in 2012, Caterham (formerly Lotus) in 2014 and Manor (formerly Virgin, then Marussia), having survived falling into administration in 2014, at the end of 2016.\nHybrid era[edit]\nA major rule shakeup in 2014 saw the 2.4-litre naturally aspirated V8 engines replaced by 1.6-litre turbocharged hybrid power units. This prompted Honda to return to the sport in 2015 as the championship's fourth power unit manufacturer. Mercedes emerged as the dominant force after the rule shakeup, with Lewis Hamilton winning the championship closely followed by his main rival and teammate, Nico Rosberg, with the team winning 16 out of the 19 races that season. The team continued this form in the next two seasons, again winning 16 races in 2015 before taking a record 19 wins in 2016, with Hamilton claiming the title in the former year and Rosberg winning it in the latter by five points. The 2016 season also saw a new team, Haas, join the grid, while Max Verstappen became the youngest-ever race winner at age 18 in Spain.[53]\nMercedes won eight consecutive constructors' titles and Lewis Hamilton won six drivers' titles during the beginning of the hybrid era.\nAfter revised aerodynamic regulations were introduced, the 2017 and 2018 seasons featured a title battle between Mercedes and Ferrari.[54][55][56][57] Mercedes ultimately won the titles with multiple races to spare and continued to dominate in the next two years,[58] eventually winning seven consecutive Drivers' Championships from 2014 to 2020 and eight consecutive Constructors' titles from 2014 to 2021. During this eight-year period between 2014 and 2021, a Mercedes driver won 111 of the 160 races,[59] with Hamilton winning 81 of these and taking six Drivers' Championships during this period to equal Schumacher's record of seven titles.[60][61][62] In 2021, the Honda-powered Red Bull team began to seriously challenge Mercedes, with Verstappen beating Hamilton to the Drivers' Championship after a season-long battle that saw the pair exchange the championship lead multiple times.\nThis era has seen an increase in car manufacturer presence in the sport. After Honda's return as an engine manufacturer in 2015, Renault came back as a team in 2016 after buying back the Lotus F1 Team. In 2018, Aston Martin and Alfa Romeo became Red Bull and Sauber's title sponsors, respectively. Sauber was rebranded as Alfa Romeo Racing for the 2019 season, while Racing Point part-owner Lawrence Stroll bought a stake in Aston Martin to rebrand the Racing Point team as Aston Martin for 2021. In August 2020, all ten F1 teams signed a new Concorde Agreement committing them to the sport until 2025, including a $145 million budget cap for car development to support equal competition and sustainable development.[63][64]\nThe COVID-19 pandemic forced the sport to adapt to budgetary and logistical limitations. A significant overhaul of the technical regulations intended to be introduced in the 2021 season was pushed back to 2022,[65] with constructors instead using their 2020 chassis for two seasons and a token system limiting which parts could be modified introduced.[66] The start of the 2020 season was delayed by several months,[67] and both it and 2021 seasons were subject to several postponements, cancellations, and rescheduling of races due to shifting restrictions on international travel. Many races took place behind closed doors and with only essential personnel present to maintain social distancing.[68]\nIn 2022, the F1 governing body announced a major rule and car design change intended to promote closer racing through the use of ground effects, new aerodynamics, larger wheels with low-profile tyres, and redesigned nose and wing regulations.[69][70] Red Bull emerged as the dominant force after the rule shakeup. The 2022 and 2023 Constructors' and Drivers' Championships were won by Red Bull and Verstappen, with multiple races to spare.[71][72][73][74]\nIn 2023 the FIA opened applications for new teams to enter Formula 1 in the then near future.[75] Of the teams that applied, only Andretti were approved by the FIA, with them then being rejected by Formula One Management, though they have launched an appeal.[76][77]\nIn early 2024, the Formula One landscape underwent a significant change in the sphere of team sponsorships and collaborations. Having competed for five seasons under the Alfa Romeo name, Sauber introduced a title partnership with the online casino Stake.com, resulting in the team's new identity as Stake F1 Team Kick Sauber. Sauber will hold Stake's sponsorship name until the end of 2025, after which it will become the Audi works team for the 2026 season onwards.[78][79] Scuderia AlphaTauri, Red Bull's junior team, dropped its name and took on sponsors from Hugo Boss and Cash App, becoming Visa Cash App RB, or VCARB for 2024. Also in 2024, Formula One announced partnerships with Mattel to release Hot Wheels die-cast cars,[80] and with Lego, with the first new sets releasing in 2025.[81] Previously, Lego sets based on Formula One cars had been released in 2024.[82]\nThe regulations governing Formula One are set to be revised for the 2026 season, with big changes planned to help encourage closer and more competitive racing.[83]\nChanges include:\nMove to fully sustainable fuels,\nReduction in width and length for closer racing\nnew Front and Rear wing regulations\nElectric Motor\nMGU-K (Motor Generator Unit – Kinetic) power increased from 120 kW to 350 kW\nMore stringent safety requirements\nTighter budget caps\nIn November 2024, General Motors reached an agreement to enter Formula 1 in 2026 with its Cadillac brand.[84]\nRacing and strategy[edit]\nMain articles: Formula One racing, Formula One tyres, Racing flags, and Formula One regulationsA Formula One Grand Prix event spans a weekend. It typically begins with two free practice sessions on Friday, and one free practice session on Saturday. Additional drivers (commonly known as third drivers) are allowed to run on Fridays, but only two cars may be used per team, requiring a race driver to give up their seat. A qualifying session is held after the last free practice session. This session determines the starting order for the race on Sunday.[85][86]\nTyre rules[edit]\nThe 2023 Pirelli tyres include (from left to right) the three slick compound tyres: soft, medium and hard – and the two wet-weather tyre compounds: intermediate and full-wet.\nEach driver may use no more than thirteen sets of dry-weather tyres, four sets of intermediate tyres, and three sets of wet-weather tyres during a race weekend.[87]\nQualifying[edit]\nFor much of the sport's history, qualifying sessions differed little from practice sessions; drivers would have one or more sessions in which to set their fastest time, with the grid order determined by each driver's best single lap, with the fastest getting first place on the grid, referred to as pole position. From 1996 to 2002, the format was a one-hour shootout. This approach lasted until the end of 2002 before the rules were changed again because the teams were not running in the early part of the session to take advantage of better track conditions later on.[88]\nGrids were generally limited to 26 cars – if the race had more entries, qualification would also decide which drivers would start the race. During the early 1990s, the number of entries was so high that the worst-performing teams had to enter a pre-qualifying session, with the fastest cars allowed through to the main qualifying session. The qualifying format began to change in the early 2000s, with the FIA experimenting with limiting the number of laps, determining the aggregate time over two sessions, and allowing each driver only one qualifying lap.\nThe current qualifying system was adopted in the 2006 season. Known as \"knock-out\" qualifying, it is split into three periods, known as Q1, Q2, and Q3. In each period, drivers run qualifying laps to attempt to advance to the next period, with the slowest drivers being \"knocked out\" of qualification (but not necessarily the race) at the end of the period and their grid positions set within the rearmost five based on their best lap times. Drivers are allowed as many laps as they wish within each period. After each period, all times are reset, and only a driver's fastest lap in that period (barring infractions) counts. Any timed lap started before the end of that period may be completed and will count toward that driver's placement. The number of cars eliminated in each period is dependent on the total number of cars entered into the championship.[89]\nCurrently, with 20 cars, Q1 runs for 18 minutes, and eliminates the slowest five drivers. During this period, any driver whose best lap takes longer than 107% of the fastest time in Q1 will not be allowed to start the race without permission from the stewards. Otherwise, all drivers proceed to the race albeit in the worst starting positions. This rule does not affect drivers in Q2 or Q3. In Q2, the 15 remaining drivers have 15 minutes to set one of the ten fastest times and proceed to the next period. Finally, Q3 lasts 12 minutes and sees the remaining ten drivers decide the first ten grid positions. At the beginning of the 2016 Formula 1 season, the FIA introduced a new qualifying format, whereby drivers were knocked out every 90 seconds after a certain amount of time had passed in each session. The aim was to mix up grid positions for the race, but due to unpopularity, the FIA reverted to the above qualifying format for the Chinese GP, after running the format for only two races.[89]\nEach car is allocated one set of the softest tyres for use in Q3. The cars that qualify for Q3 must return them after Q3; the cars that do not qualify for Q3 can use them during the race.[90] As of 2022, all drivers are given a free choice of tyre type to use at the start of the Grand Prix,[91] whereas in previous years only the drivers that did not participate in Q3 had free tyre choice for the start of the race. Any penalties that affect grid position are applied at the end of qualifying. Grid penalties can be applied for driving infractions in the previous or current Grand Prix, or for changing a gearbox or engine component. If a car fails scrutineering, the driver will be excluded from qualifying but will be allowed to start the race from the back of the grid at the race stewards' discretion.\n2021 saw the trialling of a 'sprint qualifying' race on the Saturday of three race weekends, with the intention of testing the new approach to qualifying. The traditional qualifying would determine the starting order for the sprint, and the result of the sprint would then determine the start order for the Grand Prix.[92] The system returned for the 2022 season, now titled the 'sprint'.[93] From 2023, sprint races no longer impacted the start order for the main race, which would be determined by traditional qualifying. Sprints would have their own qualifying session, titled the 'sprint shootout';[94] such a system made its debut at the 2023 Azerbaijan Grand Prix and is set to be used throughout all sprint sessions in place of the traditional second free practice session. Sprint qualifying sessions are run much shorter than traditional qualifying, and each session required teams to fit new tyres – mediums for SQ1 and SQ2, and softs for SQ3 – otherwise they cannot participate in the session.[95]\nRace[edit]\nThe race begins with a warm-up lap, after which the cars assemble on the starting grid in the order they qualified. This lap is often referred to as the formation lap, as the cars lap in formation with no overtaking (although a driver who makes a mistake may regain lost ground). The warm-up lap allows drivers to check the condition of the track and their car, gives the tyres a chance to warm up to increase traction and grip, and also gives the pit crews time to clear themselves and their equipment from the grid for the race start.\nJacques Villeneuve qualifying at the 2005 United States Grand Prix in his Sauber C24\nOnce all the cars have formed on the grid, after the medical car positions itself behind the pack,[96] a light system above the track indicates the start of the race: five red lights are illuminated at intervals of one second; they are all then extinguished simultaneously after an unspecified time (typically less than three seconds) to signal the start of the race. The start procedure may be abandoned if a driver stalls on the grid or on the track in an unsafe position, signalled by raising their arm. If this happens, the procedure restarts: a new formation lap begins with the offending car removed from the grid. The race may also be restarted in the event of a serious accident or dangerous conditions, with the original start voided. The race may be started from behind the Safety Car if race control feels a racing start would be excessively dangerous, such as extremely heavy rainfall. As of the 2019 season, there will always be a standing restart. If due to heavy rainfall a start behind the safety car is necessary, then after the track has dried sufficiently, drivers will form up for a standing start. There is no formation lap when races start behind the Safety Car.[97]\nUnder normal circumstances, the winner of the race is the first driver to cross the finish line having completed a set number of laps. Race officials may end the race early (putting out a red flag) due to unsafe conditions such as extreme rainfall, and it must finish within two hours, although races are only likely to last this long in the case of extreme weather or if the safety car is deployed during the race. When a situation justifies pausing the race without terminating it, the red flag is deployed; since 2005, a ten-minute warning is given before the race is resumed behind the safety car, which leads the field for a lap before it returns to the pit lane (before then the race resumed in race order from the penultimate lap before the red flag was shown).\nIn the 1950s, race distances varied from 300 km (190 mi) to 600 km (370 mi). The maximum race length was reduced to 400 km (250 mi) in 1966 and 325 km (202 mi) in 1971. The race length was standardized to the current 305 km (190 mi) in 1989, with the exception of the Monaco Grand Prix, which has a shorter distance due to its slower speeds and the need to keep the race under two hours.\nDrivers may overtake one another for position over the course of the race. If a leader comes across a backmarker (slower car) who has completed fewer laps, the back marker is shown a blue flag[98] telling them that they are obliged to allow the leader to overtake them. The slower car is said to be \"lapped\". Drivers who are about to be lapped are supposed to literally go out of their way and let the \"lapping\" driver pass easily. Research documents that drivers - despite being supposed to - often do not defer to the lapping driver and engage in resistance.[99] Once the leader finishes the race, is classified as finishing the race \"one lap down\". A driver can be lapped numerous times, by any car in front of them. A driver who fails to complete more than 90% of the race distance is shown as \"not classified\" in the results.\nThroughout the race, drivers may make pit stops to change tyres and repair damage (from 1994 to 2009 inclusive, they could also refuel). Different teams and drivers employ different pit stop strategies in order to maximise their car's potential. Three dry tyre compounds, with different durability and adhesion characteristics, are available to drivers. Over the course of a race, drivers must use two of the three available compounds. The different compounds have different levels of performance and choosing when to use which compound is a key tactical decision to make. Different tyres have different colours on their sidewalls; this allows spectators to understand the strategies.\nUnder wet conditions, drivers may switch to one of two specialised wet weather tyres with additional grooves (one \"intermediate\", for mild wet conditions, such as after recent rain, one \"full wet\", for racing in or immediately after rain). A driver must make at least one stop to use two tyre compounds; up to three stops are typically made, although further stops may be necessary to fix damage or if weather conditions change. If rain tyres are used, drivers are no longer obliged to use two types of dry tyres.\nRace director[edit]\nMain article: Race director § Formula One\nThis role involves managing the logistics of each F1 Grand Prix, inspecting cars in parc fermé before a race, enforcing FIA rules, and controlling the lights which start each race. As the head of the race officials, the race director also plays a large role in resolving disputes among teams and drivers. The race director may also refer incidents to the race stewards, who may give penalties, such as drive-through penalties (or stop-and-go penalties), demotions on a pre-race start grid, race disqualifications and fines should parties break regulations. As of the 2024 Las Vegas Grand Prix, the race director is Rui Marques, with Herbie Blash as a permanent advisor.[100][101]\nSafety car[edit]\nMain article: Safety car § Formula One\nIn the event of an incident that risks the safety of competitors or trackside race marshals, race officials may choose to deploy the safety car. This in effect suspends the race, with drivers following the safety car around the track at its speed in race order, with no overtaking permitted. Cars that have been lapped may, during the safety car period and depending on circumstances permitted by the race director, be allowed to un-lap themselves in order to ensure a smoother restart and to avoid blue flags being immediately thrown upon the resumption of the race with many of the cars in very close proximity to each other. The safety car circulates until the danger is cleared; after it comes in, the race restarts with a rolling start. Pit stops under a safety car are permitted, and in many cases can offer a great advantage to teams who are able to pit and change tyres prior to the end of the safety car period.[102] On the lap in which the safety car returns to the pit lane, the leading car takes over the role of the safety car until the timing line. After crossing this line, drivers are allowed to start racing for track position once more.\nMercedes-Benz has supplied a variety of its AMG models to Formula One to use as the safety car since 1996.[103] From 2021 onwards, Aston Martin has supplied the Vantage to share duties with Mercedes-AMGs.[104]The Mercedes-AMG GT R safety car at the 2019 Hungarian Grand Prix\nAn Aston Martin Safety Car during the 2022 Formula One World Championship\nSince 2000, the main safety car driver has been German ex-racing driver Bernd Mayländer.[105] He is usually joined by FIA technical assistant Richard Darker, who relays information between the safety car and race control.[106]\nVirtual Safety Car[edit]\nMain article: Safety car § Virtual safety car (VSC)\nFollowing an accident at the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix, which saw driver Jules Bianchi suffer a serious head injury that led to his death, the FIA established an \"accident panel\" to investigate the dynamics of the accident and ways to minimise the risk of a crash during similar circumstances that do not warrant the deployment of a safety car and cannot be simply managed with yellow flags. When the virtual safety car is deployed, the virtual marshal panels around the track display \"VSC\". All drivers receive a \"VSC\" notice on their steering wheels, and they must all keep their lap times above a pre-determined minimum, also known as keeping a positive delta.[107] The system was first implemented during the 2015 Monaco Grand Prix, before being upgraded to a full safety car, following a collision between Max Verstappen and Romain Grosjean.[108]\nFlags[edit]\nMain article: Racing flags\nFlags specifications and usage are prescribed by Appendix H of the FIA's International Sporting Code.[109]\nFlag\nName\nMeaning\nSC Board\n(Safety Car)\nShown in conjunction with a yellow flag to indicate that the Safety Car is on track. Full course yellow flag applies. Drivers must hold position and slow down.\nVSC Board\n(Virtual Safety Car)\nShown in conjunction with a yellow flag to indicate that the virtual safety car is in use. During this time, the drivers are given minimum sector times that they must stay above. Full course double yellow flag applies. The car's time relative to this set time is measured at each marshalling post (approximately every 50 m), and the difference is referred to as the car's \"delta\" time. This delta time is reported to the driver, and must remain positive throughout the VSC period, or else the driver will be penalised.[110]\nYellow\nIndicates a hazard on or near the track (waved yellows indicate a hazard on the track, frozen yellows indicate a hazard near the track). Double waved yellows inform drivers that they must slow down as marshals are working on or near to the track and drivers should be prepared to stop.\nGreen\nNormal racing conditions apply. This is usually shown following a yellow flag to indicate that the hazard has been passed. A green flag is shown at all stations for the lap following the end of a full-course yellow (or safety car). A green flag is also shown at the start of a session.\nYellow and red striped\nSlippery track, due to oil, water, or loose debris. Can be seen 'rocked' from side to side (not waved) to indicate a small animal on track.\nBlue\nA blue flag indicates that the driver in front must let faster cars behind them pass because they are being lapped. If the flag is missed 3 times, the driver could be penalised. Accompanied by the driver's number.\nWhite\nIndicates that there is a slow car ahead, either a race car or a course vehicle. Often waved at the end of the pit lane when a car is about to leave the pits.\nBlack and orange circle\nCar is damaged or has a mechanical problem, must return to the pit lane immediately. Will be accompanied by driver's number\nHalf black half white\nWarns a driver for poor sportsmanship or dangerous behaviour. Can be followed by a Black flag upon further infringement. Accompanied by the driver's number.\nBlack\nDriver is disqualified. Will be accompanied by the driver's number. This can be issued after a Half Black Half White flag.\nRed\nA red flag immediately halts a race or session when conditions become too dangerous to continue.\nChequered flag\nEnd of the practice, qualifying, or racing session.\nThe format of the race has changed little through Formula One's history. The main changes have revolved around what is allowed at pit stops. In the early days of Grand Prix racing, a driver would be allowed to continue a race in their teammate's car should theirs develop a problem – in the modern era, cars are so carefully fitted to drivers that this has become impossible. In recent years, the emphasis has been on changing refuelling and tyre change regulations.\nSince the 2010 season, refuelling – which was reintroduced in 1994 – has not been allowed, to encourage less tactical racing following safety concerns. The rule requiring both compounds of tyre to be used during the race was introduced in 2007, again to encourage racing on the track. The safety car is another relatively recent innovation that reduced the need to deploy the red flag, allowing races to be completed on time for a growing international live television audience.\nPoints system[edit]\nMain article: List of Formula One World Championship points scoring systems\n1st\n2nd\n3rd\n4th\n5th\n6th\n7th\n8th\n9th\n10th\n25\n18\n15\n12\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n1\nVarious systems for awarding championship points have been used since 1950. The current system, in place since 2010,[a] awards the top ten cars points in the Drivers' and Constructors' Championships, with the winner receiving 25 points. All points won at each race are added up, and the driver and constructor with the most points at the end of the season are crowned World Champions. Regardless of whether a driver stays with the same team throughout the season, or switches teams, all points earned by them count for the Drivers' Championship.[111]\nA driver must be classified in order to receive points, as of 2025[update], a driver must complete at least 90% of the race distance in order to receive points. Therefore, it is possible for a driver to receive points even if they retired before the end of the race.[112]\nFrom some time between the 1977 and 1980 seasons to the end of the 2021 season if less than 75% of the race laps were completed by the winner, then only half of the points listed in the table were awarded to the drivers and constructors. This has happened on only five occasions in the history of the championship, and it had a notable influence on the final standing of the 1984 season. The last occurrence was at the 2021 Belgian Grand Prix when the race was called off after just three laps behind a safety car because of torrential rain.[113][114] The half points rule was replaced by a distance-dependent gradual scale system for 2022.[115]\nConstructors[edit]\nSee also: List of Formula One constructors, List of Formula One engine constructors, and List of Formula One World Constructors' Champions\nFerrari (pictured with Lewis Hamilton) have competed in every season.\nA Formula One constructor is the entity credited for designing the chassis and the engine.[116] If both are designed by the same company, that company receives sole credit as the constructor (e.g., Ferrari). If they are designed by different companies, both are credited, and the name of the chassis designer is placed before that of the engine designer (e.g., McLaren-Mercedes). All constructors are scored individually, even if they share either chassis or engine with another constructor (e.g., Williams-Ford, Williams-Honda in 1983).[117] Constructors that share the engine with another constructor pay close attention - not just to their own performance - but also to the performance of other constructors using the same engine when assessing whether to extend their collaboration with an engine manufacturer.[118]\nSince 1981,[119] Formula One teams have been required to build the chassis in which they compete, and consequently the distinction between the terms \"team\" and \"constructor\" became less pronounced, though engines may still be produced by a different entity.[120] This requirement distinguishes the sport from series such as the IndyCar Series which allows teams to purchase chassis, and \"spec series\" such as Formula 2 which require all cars be kept to an identical specification. It also effectively prohibits privateers, which were common even in Formula One well into the 1970s.\nThe sport's debut season, 1950, saw eighteen teams compete, but due to high costs, many dropped out quickly. In fact, such was the scarcity of competitive cars for much of the first decade of Formula One that Formula Two cars were admitted to fill the grids. Ferrari is the oldest Formula One team, the only still-active team which competed in 1950.\nMcLaren won all but one race in 1988 with engine partner Honda.\nRenault (pictured here with Nico Hülkenberg) has had an active role in Formula One as both constructor and engine supplier since 1977.\nEarly manufacturer involvement came in the form of a \"factory team\" or \"works team\" (that is, one owned and staffed by a major car company), such as those of Alfa Romeo, Ferrari, or Renault. Ferrari holds the record for having won the most Constructors' Championships (sixteen).\nCompanies such as Climax, Repco, Cosworth, Hart, Judd and Supertec, which had no direct team affiliation, often sold engines to teams that could not afford to manufacture them. In the early years, independently owned Formula One teams sometimes also built their engines, though this became less common with the increased involvement of major car manufacturers such as BMW, Ferrari, Honda, Mercedes-Benz, Renault, and Toyota, whose large budgets rendered privately built engines less competitive. Cosworth was the last independent engine supplier.[121] It is estimated the major teams spend between €100 and €200 million ($125–$225 million) per year per manufacturer on engines alone.[122]\nIn the 2007 season, for the first time since the 1981 rule, two teams used chassis built by other teams. Super Aguri started the season using a modified Honda Racing RA106 chassis (used by Honda the previous year), while Scuderia Toro Rosso used the same chassis used by the parent Red Bull Racing team, which was formally designed by a separate subsidiary. The usage of these loopholes was ended for 2010 with the publication of new technical regulations, which require each constructor to own the intellectual property rights to their chassis,[123][124] The regulations continue to allow a team to subcontract the design and construction of the chassis to a third-party, an option used by the HRT team in 2010 and Haas currently.\nAlthough teams rarely disclose information about their budgets, it is estimated they range from US$66 million to US$400 million each.[125]\nEntering a new team in the Formula One World Championship requires a $450 million up-front payment to the FIA, which is then shared equally among the existing teams.[126] As a consequence, constructors desiring to enter Formula One often prefer to buy an existing team: BAR's purchase of Tyrrell and Midland's purchase of Jordan allowed both of these teams to sidestep the large deposit and secure the benefits the team already had, such as TV revenue.\nNine out of the ten teams competing in Formula One have some form of base in England, in an area centred around Oxfordshire called \"Motorsport Valley\".[127] Ferrari is the only team to not have an English presence and have both their chassis and engine assembly in Maranello, Italy. Racing Bulls is based close to Ferrari in Faenza but also has a base in Milton Keynes,[128] whilst Sauber is based in Hinwil, Switzerland with a \"technology centre\" in Bicester.[129] Haas is U.S.-based and has its primary base in Kannapolis, North Carolina with another facility in Banbury and a design office in Maranello.[127][130][131] The Cadillac team joining the grid in 2026 is set to have bases in Fishers, Indiana, Warren, Michigan and Silverstone.[132]\nDrivers[edit]\nSee also: List of Formula One drivers, List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions, and List of Formula One driver numbers\n2005 Canadian Grand Prix: Kimi Räikkönen leading Michael Schumacher, with Jarno Trulli (Toyota) and Takuma Sato (BAR-Honda) fighting for position\nEvery team in Formula One must run two cars in every session in a Grand Prix weekend, and every team may use up to four drivers in a season.[86] A team may also run two additional drivers in Free Practice sessions,[86] which are often used to test potential new drivers for a career as a Formula One driver or gain experienced drivers to evaluate the car.[133][134] Most drivers are contracted for at least the duration of a season, with driver changes taking place in-between seasons, in comparison to early years when drivers often competed on an ad hoc basis from race to race. Each competitor must be in the possession of a FIA Super Licence to compete in a Grand Prix,[135] which is issued to drivers who have met the criteria of success in junior motorsport categories and having achieved 300 kilometres (190 mi) of running in a Formula One car. Drivers may also be issued a Super Licence by the World Motor Sport Council if they fail to meet the criteria.[135] Although most drivers earn their seat on ability, commercial considerations also come into play with teams having to satisfy sponsors and financial demands.\nTeams also contract test and reserve drivers to stand in for regular drivers when necessary and develop the team's car; although with the reduction on testing the reserve drivers' role mainly takes places on a simulator,[136] such as rFpro,[137][138] which is used by most of the F1 teams.[139][140]\nEach driver chooses an unassigned number from 2 to 99 (excluding 17 which was retired following the death of Jules Bianchi)[141] upon entering Formula One and keeps that number during their time in the series. The number one is reserved for the reigning Drivers' Champion, who retains their previous number and may choose to use it instead of the number one.[142] At the onset of the championship, numbers were allocated by race organisers on an ad hoc basis from race to race.[143]\nPermanent numbers were introduced in 1973 to take effect in 1974, when teams were allocated numbers in ascending order based on the Constructors' Championship standings at the end of the 1973 season. The teams would hold those numbers from season to season with the exception of the team with the World Drivers' Champion, which would swap its numbers with the one and two of the previous champion's team. New entrants were allocated spare numbers, with the exception of the number 13 which had been unused since 1976.[144]\nThe trophy given to the F1 World Drivers' Champion at the end of the season\nAs teams kept their numbers for long periods of time, car numbers became associated with a team, such as Ferrari's 27 and 28.[143] A different system was used from 1996 to 2013: at the start of each season, the current Drivers' Champion was designated number one, their teammate number two, and the rest of the teams assigned ascending numbers according to previous season's Constructors' Championship order.[145]\nAs of 2024[update], a total of 34 separate drivers have won the World Drivers' Championship, with Michael Schumacher and Lewis Hamilton holding the record for most championships with seven. Lewis Hamilton achieved the most race wins, too, in 2020. Jochen Rindt is the only posthumous World Champion, after his points total was not surpassed despite his fatal accident at the 1970 Italian Grand Prix, with 4 races still remaining in the season. Drivers from the United Kingdom have been the most successful in the sport, with 20 championships among 10 drivers, and 322 wins.[146]\nPhysical demands[edit]\nDriving in Formula One is highly demanding physically, with drivers typically burning around 1,000 calories per hour and losing 2–4 kg (4–9 lb) of weight per race.[147][148] A key reason for the physical demands is the extreme g-forces generated by driving at high speeds, with modern Formula One cars capable of generating forces of up to 6.5 gs when cornering, 6 gs when braking and 2 gs when accelerating.[149][150][151] When a driver experiences 6 g, they will feel a force equivalent to six times their body weight; for a person weighing 80 kg (176 lb), this would be 480 kg (1,058 lb).[152] Another factor is the high temperature inside the car, as the engine is mounted directly behind the driver. The temperature in the cockpit of a Formula One car can be as high as 60 °C (140 °F) and drivers have to wear several layers of fireproof racing clothing.[153][154] The steering wheel and brake pedal also require considerable strength to operate. Before the introduction of power steering in the 2000s, drivers had to cope with steering forces of up to 40–50 newton-metres (30–37 lb⋅ft),[155][156] while achieving maximum braking power requires drivers to apply around 150 kg (330 lb) of force to the brake pedal.[157] Drivers also need to be light, as every extra kilogram of weight noticeably reduces performance.[147] Drivers also need to train on cardiovascular fitness since heart rates can average more than 170 bpm during a race; this is more than a healthy adult would typically experience while running.[158]\nFeeder series[edit]\nSee also: Formula racing and FIA Global Pathway from Karting to Formula OneFIA Formula 2 Championship, the main F1 feeder series since 2017\nFIA Formula 3 Championship, the main F1 and F2 feeder series since 2019\nMost F1 drivers start in kart racing competitions and then progress through traditional entry level European single-seater series such as Formula Ford,[159] Formula Renault,[160] and Formula 4.[161] From there, drivers typically progress to higher level regional championships at the Formula Three level. This included championships like British F3 and European F3 historically, although similar series now hold the Formula Regional designation. In addition to this, there are also international F3 championships, including GP3 and its present-day successor FIA F3.[162] The highest level series on the F1 ladder is the FIA Formula 2 Championship. In the past, the top level series was GP2 (2005–2016), International Formula 3000 (1985–2004 under the Formula 3000 class), and Formula Two (1948–1984).[163]\nDrivers are not required to have competed at this level before entering Formula One. British F3 has supplied many F1 drivers, with champions, including Nigel Mansell, Ayrton Senna and Mika Häkkinen having moved straight from that series to Formula One, and Max Verstappen made his F1 debut following a single season in European F3. More rarely a driver may be picked from an even lower level, as was the case with 2007 World Champion Kimi Räikkönen, who went straight from Formula Renault to F1.[164]\nAmerican open-wheel car racing has also contributed to the Formula One grid. CART champions Mario Andretti and Jacques Villeneuve became F1 World Champions, while Juan Pablo Montoya won seven races in F1.[165]\nGrands Prix[edit]\nSee also: List of Formula One Grands Prix\nWorld map showing the location of Formula 1 Grands Prix: countries marked in green are on the current race schedule, those in dark grey have hosted a Formula One race in the past. (De facto status of the territories is shown.)\nThe number of Grands Prix held in a season has varied over the years. The inaugural 1950 World Championship season comprised only seven races, while the 2024 season contained 24 races, the highest number of World Championship races in one season.[166] There were no more than 11 Grands Prix per season during the early decades of the championship, although a large number of non-championship Formula One events also took place. The number of Grands Prix increased to an average of 16 to 17 by the late 1970s, while non-championship events ended in 1983. More Grands Prix began to be held in the 2000s, and recent seasons have seen an average of 21 races.\nSix of the original seven races took place in Europe; the only non-European race that counted towards the World Championship in 1950 was the Indianapolis 500, which was held to different regulations and later replaced by the United States Grand Prix. The F1 championship gradually expanded to other non-European countries. Argentina hosted the first South American Grand Prix in 1953, and Morocco hosted the first African World Championship race in 1958. Asia and Oceania followed (Japan in 1976 and Australia in 1985), and the first race in the Middle East was held in 2004. The 19 races of the 2014 season were spread over every populated continent except for Africa, with 10 Grands Prix held outside Europe.\nSome of the Grands Prix pre-date the formation of the World Championship, such as the French Grand Prix and were incorporated into the championship as Formula One races in 1950. The British and Italian Grands Prix are the only events to have been held every Formula One season; other long-running races include the Belgian, German, and French Grands Prix. The Monaco Grand Prix was first held in 1929 and has run continuously since 1955 (with the exception of 2020) and is widely considered to be one of the most important and prestigious automobile races in the world.[167]\nAll Grands Prix have traditionally been run during the day, until the inaugural Singapore Grand Prix hosted the first Formula One night race in 2008,[168] which was followed by the day–night Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in 2009 and the Bahrain Grand Prix which converted to a night race in 2014. Other Grands Prix in Asia have had their start times adjusted to benefit the European television audience.[169]\nContracted Grands Prix[edit]\nThe following twenty-four Grands Prix have a contract to be hosted at the listed circuits for the 2026 season:\nGrand Prix\nCircuit\nContract ends\nRef.\nAbu Dhabi Grand Prix\nYas Marina Circuit, Abu Dhabi\n2030\n[170]\nAustralian Grand Prix\nAlbert Park Circuit, Melbourne\n2037\n[171]\nAustrian Grand Prix\nRed Bull Ring, Spielberg\n2041\n[172]\nAzerbaijan Grand Prix\nBaku City Circuit, Baku\n2026\n[173]\nBahrain Grand Prix\nBahrain International Circuit, Sakhir\n2036\n[174]\nBarcelona-Catalunya Grand Prix\nCircuit de Barcelona-Catalunya, Montmeló\n2026\n[175]\nBelgian Grand Prix\nCircuit de Spa-Francorchamps, Stavelot\n2031[b]\n[176]\nBritish Grand Prix\nSilverstone Circuit, Silverstone\n2034\n[177]\nCanadian Grand Prix\nCircuit Gilles Villeneuve, Montreal\n2031\n[178]\nChinese Grand Prix\nShanghai International Circuit, Shanghai\n2030\n[179]\nDutch Grand Prix\nCircuit Zandvoort, Zandvoort\n2026\n[180]\nHungarian Grand Prix\nHungaroring, Mogyoród\n2032\n[181]\nItalian Grand Prix\nMonza Circuit, Monza\n2031\n[182]\nJapanese Grand Prix\nSuzuka International Racing Course, Suzuka\n2029\n[183]\nLas Vegas Grand Prix\nLas Vegas Strip Circuit, Paradise, Nevada\n2027\n[184]\nMexico City Grand Prix\nAutódromo Hermanos Rodríguez, Mexico City\n2028\n[185]\nMiami Grand Prix\nMiami International Autodrome, Miami Gardens, Florida\n2041\n[186]\nMonaco Grand Prix\nCircuit de Monaco, Monaco\n2031\n[187]\nQatar Grand Prix\nLusail International Circuit, Lusail\n2032\n[188]\nSão Paulo Grand Prix\nInterlagos Circuit, São Paulo\n2030\n[189]\nSaudi Arabian Grand Prix\nJeddah Corniche Circuit, Jeddah\n2030\n[190]\nSingapore Grand Prix\nMarina Bay Street Circuit, Singapore\n2028\n[191]\nSpanish Grand Prix\nMadring, Madrid\n2035\n[192]\nUnited States Grand Prix\nCircuit of the Americas, Austin, Texas\n2026\n[193]\nThe Saudi Arabian Grand Prix will move to a purpose built circuit in Qiddiya in 2028.\nThe Spanish Grand Prix will move to Madring in Madrid in 2026.\nThe Emilia Romagna Grand Prix is contracted for 2025, but do not have a contract for 2026.[194]\nReturning additions (2008–present)[edit]\nBold denotes the Grands Prix scheduled as part of the 2025 season.\nEuropean Grand Prix at Valencia Street Circuit (2008–2012)\nUnited States Grand Prix at Circuit of the Americas (2012–2019, 2021–present)\nAustrian Grand Prix at Red Bull Ring (2014–present)\nMexican Grand Prix at Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez (2015–2019); renamed Mexico City Grand Prix (2021–present)[195]\nEuropean Grand Prix at Baku City Circuit (2016; renamed the Azerbaijan Grand Prix for 2017–2019, 2021–present)\nFrench Grand Prix at Circuit Paul Ricard (2018–2019, 2021–2022)\nPortuguese Grand Prix at Algarve International Circuit (2020–2021)[c]\nImola Circuit with the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix (2020–2022, 2024–2025; previously hosted the Italian Grand Prix and the San Marino Grand Prix)[d]\nDutch Grand Prix at Circuit Zandvoort (2021–present)\nNew Locations Initiative (2008–present)[edit]\nBold denotes the Grands Prix scheduled as part of the 2025 season.\nSince 2008, the Formula One Group has been targeting new \"destination cities\" to expand its global reach, with the aim to produce races from countries that have not previously been involved in the sport.

In most cases, the tracks run in a clockwise direction, although there are a handful of tracks in the Championship that run anticlockwise.\nA typical circuit features a stretch of straight road on which the starting grid is situated, with the pit lane normally located right next to it. The pit lane is home to each team's garage, where cars are stored and serviced before a race. During a pit stop, drivers enter the pit lane to change their tyres, receive repairs or aerodynamic adjustments from their pit crew, or retire from the race (if the car is in a condition to do so). Prior to the 2010 season, pit stops also facilitated mid-race refueling of the cars.[199] Special pit roads and track markings help to make sure drivers pit and rejoin the track safely.\nMost of the circuits currently in use are specially constructed for competition, but the calendar also features several circuits that use converted public streets to varying degrees. These tracks include Monaco, Melbourne, Singapore, Baku, Miami, Jeddah, and Las Vegas. Three-time World champion Nelson Piquet famously described racing in Monaco as \"like riding a bicycle around your living room\".[200] The Monaco Grand Prix holds a unique exception to the FIA's minimum race distance requirement—the Grand Prix only needs to last enough laps to cover a distance of 260 km, versus the standard 305 km.[201][202]\nCircuit design to protect the safety of drivers is becoming increasingly sophisticated, as exemplified by the Bahrain International Circuit, added in 2004 and designed – like most of F1's new circuits – by Hermann Tilke. Several of the new circuits in F1, especially those designed by Tilke, have been criticised as lacking the \"flow\" of such classics as Spa-Francorchamps and Imola.[203] His redesign of the Hockenheim circuit in Germany for example, while providing more capacity for grandstands and eliminating extremely long and dangerous straights, has been frowned upon by many who argue that part of the character of the Hockenheim circuits was the long and blinding straights into dark forest sections. These newer circuits, however, are generally agreed to meet the safety standards of modern Formula One better than the older ones.[204]\nThe Circuit of the Americas in Austin, the Sochi Autodrom in Sochi and the Baku City Circuit in Azerbaijan have all been introduced as brand new tracks since 2012. In 2020, Algarve International Circuit debuted on the F1 calendar as the venue of the Portuguese Grand Prix, with the country having last hosted a race in 1996.[c] In 2021, Circuit Zandvoort returned to the F1 calendar as the Dutch Grand Prix, having last hosted a race in 1985.[205] The Las Vegas Grand Prix entered the sport in 2023.[206]\nCars and technology[edit]\nMain articles: Formula One car, Formula One engines, and Formula One tyres\nJenson Button in the Brawn BGP 001\nModern Formula One cars are mid-engined, hybrid, semi-open cockpit, open-wheel single-seaters. The chassis is made largely of carbon-fibre composites, rendering it light but extremely stiff and strong. The whole car, including the driver but not fuel, weighs only 800 kg (1,800 lb) – the minimum weight set by the regulations.[207] If the construction of the car is lighter than the minimum, it can be ballasted up to add the necessary weight. The race teams take advantage of this by placing this ballast at the extreme bottom of the chassis, thereby locating the centre of gravity as low as possible in order to improve handling and weight transfer.[208]\nThe cornering speed of Formula One cars is largely determined by the aerodynamic downforce that they generate, which pushes the car down onto the track. This is provided by \"wings\" mounted at the front and rear of the vehicle, and by ground effect created by low air pressure under the flat bottom of the car. The aerodynamic design of the cars is very heavily constrained to limit performance. The previous generation of cars sported a large number of small winglets, \"barge boards\", and turning vanes designed to closely control the flow of the air over, under, and around the car.\nThe other major factor controlling the cornering speed of the cars is the design of the tyres. From 1998 to 2008, the tyres in Formula One were not \"slicks\" (tyres with no tread pattern) as in most other circuit racing series. Instead, each tyre had four large circumferential grooves on its surface designed to limit the cornering speed of the cars.[209] Slick tyres returned to Formula One in the 2009 season. Suspension is double wishbone or multilink front and rear, with pushrod operated springs and dampers on the chassis – one exception being that of the 2009 specification Red Bull Racing car (RB5) which used pullrod suspension at the rear, the first car to do so since the Minardi PS01 in 2001. Ferrari used a pullrod suspension at both the front and rear in their 2012 car.[210] Both Ferrari (F138) and McLaren (MP4-28) of the 2013 season used a pullrod suspension at both the front and the rear. In 2022, McLaren (MCL36) and Red Bull Racing (RB18) switched to a pullrod front suspension and push rod rear suspension.[211][212]\nCarbon-carbon disc brakes are used for reduced weight and increased frictional performance. These provide a very high level of braking performance and are usually the element that provokes the greatest reaction from drivers new to the formula. The carbon[213] material enhances the brakes by maintaining an effective performance[214] under extreme heat. To optimise this, the brakes feature 1,000 ventilation holes, ensuring for maximum performance and cooling.\nIn 2022, the technical regulations changed considerably in order to reduce the turbulence (commonly referred to as \"dirty air\") produced by the aerodynamics of the car. This includes a redesigned front and rear wing, larger wheels with a lower tyre profile, wheel covers, small winglets, the banning of barge boards, and the reintroduction of Ground effect downforce production. These have been changed to promote racing, meaning cars lose less downforce when following another car. It allows cars to follow another at a much closer distance, without extending the gap due to the turbulent air.[215] (See 2022 Formula One World Championship Technical regulations)\nFormula One cars must have four wheels made of the same metallic material, which must be one of two magnesium alloys specified by the FIA.[216] Magnesium alloy wheels made by forging are used to achieve maximum unsprung rotating weight reduction.[217] As of 2022, the wheels are covered with \"spec\" (Standardised) Wheel Covers, the wheel diameter has increased from 13 inches to 18 inches (reducing the \"tyre profile\"), and small winglets have been placed over the front tyres.[218]\nA BMW Sauber P86 V8 engine, which powered their 2006 F1.06\nStarting with the 2014 Formula 1 season, the engines have changed from a 2.4-litre naturally aspirated V8 to turbocharged 1.6-litre V6 power-units.[219] These get a significant amount of their power from electric motors. In addition, they include a lot of energy recovery technology. Engines run on unleaded fuel closely resembling publicly available petrol.[220] The oil which lubricates and protects the engine from overheating is very similar in viscosity to water. The 2006 generation of engines spun up to 20,000 rpm and produced over 580 kW (780 bhp).[221] For 2007, engines were restricted to 19,000 rpm with limited development areas allowed, following the engine specification freeze since the end of 2006.[222] For the 2009 Formula One season the engines were further restricted to 18,000 rpm.[223]\nA wide variety of technologies – including active suspension[224] are banned under the current regulations. Despite this the current generation of cars can reach speeds in excess of 350 km/h (220 mph) at some circuits.[225] The highest straight line speed recorded during a Grand Prix was 372.6 km/h (231.5 mph), set by Juan Pablo Montoya during the 2005 Italian Grand Prix.[226] During qualifying for the 2016 European Grand Prix, Valtteri Bottas set a record top speed of 378 km/h (234.9 mph).[227] A BAR-Honda Formula One car, running with minimum downforce on a runway in the Mojave Desert achieved a top speed of 415 km/h (258 mph) in 2006. According to Honda, the car fully met the FIA Formula One regulations.[228]\nEven with the limitations on aerodynamics, at 160 km/h (99 mph) aerodynamically generated downforce is equal to the weight of the car, and the oft-repeated claim that Formula One cars create enough downforce to \"drive on the ceiling\", while possible in principle, has never been put to the test. Downforce of 2.5 times the car's weight can be achieved at full speed. The downforce means that the cars can achieve a lateral force with a magnitude of up to 3.5 times that of the force of gravity (3.5g) in cornering.[229] Consequently, the driver's head is pulled sideways with a force equivalent to the weight of 20 kg in corners. Such high lateral forces are enough to make breathing difficult and the drivers need supreme concentration and fitness to maintain their focus for the one to two hours that it takes to complete the race. A high-performance road car like the Enzo Ferrari only achieves around 1g.[230]\nAs of 2019[update], each team may have no more than two cars available for use at any time.[231] Each driver may use no more than four engines during a championship season unless they drive for more than one team. If more engines are used, they drop ten places on the starting grid of the event at which an additional engine is used. The only exception is where the engine is provided by a manufacturer or supplier taking part in its first championship season, in which case up to five may be used by a driver.[232] Each driver may use no more than one gearbox for six consecutive events; every unscheduled gearbox change requires the driver to drop five places on the grid unless they failed to finish the previous race due to reasons beyond the team's control.[233]\nAs of 2019[update], each driver is limited to three power units per season, before incurring grid penalties.\nRevenue and profits[edit]\nThis section needs to be updated. The reason given is: Needs update to account for the ban in private testing.. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (October 2024)\nEstimated budget split of a Formula One team based on the 2006 season\nIn March 2007, F1 Racing published its annual estimates of spending by Formula One teams.[234] The total spending of all eleven teams in 2006 was estimated at $2.9 billion US. This was broken down as follows: Toyota $418.5 million, Ferrari $406.5 m, McLaren $402 m, Honda $380.5 m, BMW Sauber $355 m, Renault $324 m, Red Bull $252 m, Williams $195.5 m, Midland F1/Spyker-MF1 $120 m, Toro Rosso $75 m, and Super Aguri $57 million.\nCosts vary greatly from team to team. Honda, Toyota, McLaren-Mercedes, and Ferrari were estimated to have spent approximately $200 million on engines in 2006, Renault spent approximately $125 million and Cosworth's 2006 V8 was developed for $15 million.[235] In contrast to the 2006 season on which these figures are based, the 2007 sporting regulations banned all performance-related engine development.[236]\nFormula One teams pay entry fees of $500,000, plus $5,000 per point scored the previous year or $6,000 per point for the winner of the Constructors' Championship. Formula One drivers pay a FIA Super Licence fee, which in 2013 was €10,000 plus €1,000 per point.[237]\nThere have been controversies with the way profits are shared among the teams. The smaller teams have complained that the profits are unevenly shared, favouring established top teams. In September 2015, Force India and Sauber officially lodged a complaint with the European Union against Formula One questioning the governance and stating that the system of dividing revenues and determining the rules is unfair and unlawful.[238]\nThe cost of building a brand-new permanent circuit can be up to hundreds of millions of dollars, while the cost of converting a public road, such as Albert Park, into a temporary circuit is much less. Permanent circuits, however, can generate revenue all year round from leasing the track for private races and other races, such as MotoGP. The Shanghai International Circuit cost over $300 million[239] and the Istanbul Park circuit cost $150 million to build.[240]\nA number of Formula One drivers earn the highest salary of any drivers in auto racing. The highest-paid driver in 2021 is Lewis Hamilton, who received $55 million in salary from Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 – a record for any driver.[241] The very top Formula One drivers get paid more than IndyCar or NASCAR drivers; however, the earnings immediately fall off after the top three F1 drivers, and the majority of NASCAR racers will make more money than their F1 counterparts.[242] Most top IndyCar drivers are paid around a tenth of their Formula One counterparts.[241]\nIn the second quarter of 2020, Formula One reported a loss revenue of $122 million and an income of $24 million. This was a result of the delay of the racing championship start as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The company grossed revenues of $620 million for the same quarter the previous year.[243]\nCost cap[edit]\nSince the beginning of Formula 1 back in 1950, the sport's governing body has not had any regulations limiting the spending of a team. This has led to a pattern where teams with large budgets perform significantly better than their competitors and the gap has only continued to increase.[244]\nFor instance, in 2019, the richest teams such as Mercedes and Ferrari spent $420 million and $435 million respectively,[245] whereas teams such as Williams or Haas, only spent $125 million and $150 million respectively.[246] This gap was widening by the season and disparities like this prompted the FIA to introduce a cost cap in February 2021.\nThe FIA proposed the cost cap as a measure to reward engineering prowess over sheer expenditure. They did this in an effort to bridge the gap between the midfield teams and the teams challenging for the driver's and constructors' titles.\nThe cap was $175 million in 2021, although was reduced further to $145 million in response to economic turmoil due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For 2022, the cost cap was further reduced to $140 million and in 2023 it fell to $135 million where it will remain for the 2024 and 2025 seasons.[247][248]\nThe 2022 season served as a critical test for the effectiveness of the cost cap as it was the year the new regulations were introduced, allowing all teams to start from scratch and build a car that was independent of the previous years. Critics have argued that the cap might not be sufficient to close the gap in competition because it excluded certain expenses like driver salaries, compensation for the three highest paid-staff members, and marketing costs along with loopholes that allowed the likes of Adrian Newey's salary of Red Bull to be excluded from the cost cap.[247] They also contended that established teams could exploit existing infrastructures and resources accumulated over years, thus maintaining their competitive edge despite the spending limits.\nHowever, an alternative perspective highlights that the cost cap encourages teams to maximise efficiency and foster innovation within their financial means. McLaren started the 2023 season as the slowest car on the track, with their drivers finishing outside the points with Lando Norris at P17 and Oscar Piastri at P20. Seven months later, with the right upgrades, they managed to be the fastest car on the grid throughout qualifying and race pace. Facing budgetary constraints similar to their competitors, McLaren focused on strategic engineering upgrades and talent development. Their significant mid-season improvements led to notable on-track success, demonstrating that with clever resource management and engineering talent, teams can challenge the dominance of traditionally wealthier competitors.\nMcLaren CEO Zak Brown said that \"the cap has been outstanding for the sport.\" He also went on to say that there is a feeling that at any point in the season, any team can challenge for a place it wasn't equipped to do so at the start of the season.[249]\nThe critics have expressed that the impact of the cost cap suggests that engineering excellence and strategic ingenuity can indeed offset the advantages of larger budgets. By promoting a more balanced competitive environment, the cost cap has made Formula 1 more exciting for fans and more viable for teams.\nFuture[edit]\nA sign announcing that the safety car (SC) is deployed\nThe expense of Formula One has seen the FIA and the Formula One Commission attempt to create new regulations to lower the costs for a team to compete in the sport.[250][251]\nFollowing their purchase of the commercial rights to the sport in 2017, Liberty Media announced their vision for the future of Formula One at the 2018 Bahrain Grand Prix. The proposal identified five key areas, including streamlining the governance of the sport, emphasising cost-effectiveness, maintaining the sport's relevance to road cars and encouraging new manufacturers to enter the championship whilst enabling them to be competitive.[252]\nOn 19 August 2020, it was announced that all 10 teams had signed the new Concorde Agreement.[253] This came into effect at the start of the 2021 season and changed how prize money and TV revenue is distributed.[254]\nEnvironmental impact[edit]\nFormula One has initiated a plan to become carbon neutral by 2030. By 2025, all events should have become \"sustainable\", including eliminating single-use plastics and ensuring all waste is reused, recycled or composted.[255]\nA report conducted by Formula One estimated that the series was responsible for 256,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions in the 2019 season, finding that 45% of emissions were from logistics and only 0.7% were from emissions from the cars themselves.[256][257]\nIn January 2020, FIA and Formula One signed the United Nations \"Sports for Climate Action\" framework. After the signing was announced, FIA President Jean Todt said: \"As an international Federation comprising 244 members in 140 countries and the leader in motor sport and mobility development, we are fully committed to global environmental protection. The signing of this UN Sports for Climate Action Framework reinforces the momentum that has been growing in our Federation for many years. Since the introduction of the hybrid power unit in F1 to the creation of the Environment and Sustainability Commission, the entire FIA community has been investing time, energy and financial resources to the benefit of environmental innovations. We aim to inspire greater awareness and best practice in sustainability motor sport standards.\"[258]\nFrom the 2021–22 season, all cars increased the bio-component of their fuel, using E10 fuel, rather than the 5.75% of ethanol previously used. This percentage is expected to grow again in the future.[259] In December 2020, the FIA claimed that it had developed a fuel with 100% sustainability, to be used in Formula One from either 2025 or 2026, when new engine regulations come into force.[260]\nSocial inequities[edit]\nPrior to the beginning of the 2020 Formula One World Championship, F1 announced and launched the #WeRaceAsOne initiative.[261] The initiative primarily focuses on visible displays of solidarity in the fight against racism on Grand Prix Weekends, as well as the creation of a Formula 1 Task Force that will \"listen to people from across the paddock [...] and make conclusions on the actions required to improve the diversity and opportunity in Formula 1 at all levels\".[261] The move spurs from the growing questions about racism and global inequalities perpetuated by the sport. The 70-year history of the World Championship has been dominated by European and white drivers, with the first (and only) black driver, Lewis Hamilton, participating in the world championship since 2007.[262]\nIn addition to organization-wide measures, individual teams have also acknowledged deficiencies in the sport's cultural and political activism. During the 2020 season, the Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 Team conducted a study of its racial composition and found that approximately 95% of its workforce was white.[263] Due to the results of the study, the team changed the car's livery to promote anti-racism messages and also launched the Accelerate 25 programme. The program vows that approximately 25% of all new hires to the team will come from underrepresented minorities in the sport until 2025.[264]\nThe 20 drivers on the grid have also stood in solidarity on multiple occasions in the fight against racism both on and off the track. Following the murder of George Floyd in the summer of 2020, all twenty drivers wore \"End Racism\" shirts and took part in an organised anti-racism protest during the pre-race formalities.[265] In the year since, Lewis Hamilton has remained vocal in his pre-race attire, with other drivers occasionally wearing change-demanding clothing.[266]\nWomen in Formula One[edit]\nSince the creation of Formula One, in 1950, there have been five women to compete in a Grand Prix, and only one managed to score. The involvement of women in the Formula One paddock ranges from race engineers and strategists to media and communications personnel. With the release of the Netflix show, Drive to Survive, the female viewership of the sport has risen. In 2019, 20% of the total Formula One viewership was female, and by 2022 this number had increased to 40%.[267]\nF1 Academy[edit]\nF1 Academy, created by Formula One in 2023, is the only female single-seater racing championship. Its inaugural championship was won by Marta García of Prema Racing. The establishment of F1 Academy has attracted significant levels of attention to women in motorsport; Netflix has announced the release of a docuseries in 2025 about the academy. In addition to this companies such as Tommy Hilfiger, Charlotte Tilbury,[268] Puma, and Red Bull have become sponsors of F1 Academy due to its increasing popularity.[269]\nFemale Formula One drivers[edit]\nMaria Teresa de Filippis was the first woman to compete in a Formula One Grand Prix at the 1958 Monaco Grand Prix. She competed in a total of five Grand Prix, racing under the Italian flag and has been hailed a pioneer of women in motorsport.[270]\nLella Lombardi is the only woman to place within the points at a Formula One Grand Prix. She competed in three seasons, entering seventeen races, and starting twelve. After finishing sixth in the 1975 Spanish Grand Prix, Lombardi became the first and only woman to score points during an official Formula Grand Prix. Due to the race not reaching full completion half points were awarded and Lombardi only gained .5 points.[271]\nDesiré Wilson is the only woman to win a Formula One race of any kind, winning the second round of the 1980 Aurora AFX F1 Championship.\nGiovanna Amati was the last female driver to attempt to qualify for a Formula One Grand Prix. In 1992, she was signed by Brabham and participated in three races—South Africa, Mexico, and Brazil—but failed to qualify for any of them. Amati faced significant challenges, including an underperforming car and limited testing opportunities. She was replaced by Damon Hill after Brabham struggled with financial difficulties and performance issues. Despite not making a race start, her entry remains significant, as no woman has attempted to qualify for a Grand Prix since. Her participation also marked the last time a female driver was officially listed on an F1 entry list until Susie Wolff took part in free practice sessions for Williams in 2014.[272][273][274]\nRace engineers[edit]\nHannah Schmitz currently holds the role of principal strategy engineer at Red Bull Racing. She has been with the team since 2009 and played a strong presence in its victories in 2021, 2022, and 2023. In 2023 Schmitz won the McLaren Applied Female Engineer of the Year Award winner for her role within Red Bull Racing.[275]\nBeginning in 2025, Laura Müller has served as the race engineer for Esteban Ocon at Haas, making her the first female to serve as a race engineer on a full time basis.[276][277]\nTeam principals[edit]\nSusie Wolff is the current managing director of F1 Academy, however her presence within the Formula One paddock has lasted several decades. In the beginning of her career she was told to drive a pink car, although she was skeptical, Wolff obliged figuring that young girls would see the car and feel more inspired to begin racing.[278] In 2012 Wolff was a Williams Grand Prix Engineering development driver, during her four years at Williams, she competed in several free practice sessions for the team. After her time at Williams, Wolff became the team principal of Formula E team Venturi Racing, and saw the team to their most successful season to date.\nAustrian Monisha Kaltenborn became the sport's first ever female Team principal when she took over the role at Sauber Formula 1 Team in 2010.[279]\nMedia coverage[edit]\nSee also: List of Formula One broadcasters\nFormula One is broadcast live, or tape delayed, in almost every country and territory and attracts one of the largest global television audiences. The 2008 season attracted a global audience of 600 million people per race.[280] The cumulative television audience for the 2001 season, which was broadcast to 200 territories, was calculated to be 54 billion.[281]\n2015 Malaysian GP opening lap. This is an example of the media coverage in F1\nDuring the early 1990s, Formula One Group introduced updated branding, an official logo, an official TV graphics package and in 2003, an official website in an attempt to give the competition a corporate identity.\nAll broadcasters are provided with an identical world feed produced by Formula One Management (FOM), though for some races it was previously provided by local broadcasters. The host broadcaster either had one feed for all, or two separate feeds – a feed for local viewers and a feed for international viewers. The one size fits all approach meant that there was bias to a certain team or driver during the event, which led to viewers missing out on more important action and incidents, while the two-feed approach meant that replays (for when returning from an ad break) and local bias action could be overlaid on the local feed while the international feed was left unaffected.[citation needed]\nAn enhanced package called F1 Digital+ was launched by FOM in 1996, which included live broadcast of all sessions live as well as additional channels including onboard and pit-lane cameras. It was initially only offered in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, though it later became available in France, Italy, Spain and the UK. The service was never financially viable and was discontinued at the end of the 2002 season.\nOn 12 January 2011, F1 announced that it would adopt the HD format for the 2011 season.[282]\nThe official Formula One website has live timing charts that can be used during the race to follow the leaderboard in real time. An official application has been available for the Apple App Store since 2009,[283] and on Google Play since 2011,[284] that shows users a real-time feed of driver positions, timing and commentary.[285] On 26 November 2017 Formula One unveiled a new logo, which replaced the previous \"flying one\" in use since 1993.[286]\nIn March 2018, FOM announced the launch of F1 TV, an over-the-top streaming platform that lets viewers watch multiple simultaneous video feeds and timing screens in addition to traditional directed race footage and commentary.[287] In April 2024, FOM launched a free ad-supported streaming television channel known as the Formula 1 Channel in the United States, which shows classic Grands Prix, documentaries and analysis from past races.[288]\nTelevision broadcasters[edit]\nIt was announced on 29 July 2011, that Sky Sports and the BBC would team up to show the races in F1 from 2012 to 2018. Sky launched a dedicated channel, Sky Sports F1 which covered all races live without commercial interruption as well as live practice and qualifying sessions, along with F1 programming, including interviews, archive action and magazine shows.[289] In 2012 the BBC broadcast live coverage of half of the races in the season.[290] The BBC ended its television contract after the 2015 season, three years earlier than planned.[291] The free-to-air TV rights were picked up by Channel 4 until the end of the 2018 season.[292] Sky Sports F1 coverage remained unaffected and BBC Radio 5 Live and 5 Sports Extra coverage was extended until 2021.[293] As of 2022, BBC Radio 5 Live and 5 Sports Extra has rights to such coverage until 2024.[294]\nIn south-east Asia, the middle east and north Africa, Formula One is broadcast by beIN Sports. In India, sessions are broadcast by streaming service FanCode and satellite television provider Tata Play. In China, the rights are held by Tencent, Guangdong TV and Shanghai TV.[295]\nIn the United States, ESPN has held the rights since 2013, carrying the broadcast and commentary feed provided by Sky Sports UK.[296] Some races are also broadcast free-to-air on ABC under the ESPN on ABC banner.[citation needed] According to The Athletic, the fee paid by ESPN is estimated at $90 million per year as of 2025, with the current deal set to expire after the 2025 season.[296]\nIn Germany, Austria and Switzerland, the exclusive rights are held by pay TV broadcaster Sky Sport. The rights were previously shared with free-to-air channel RTL for many years, which had broadcast all Formula One qualifying and racing sessions since 1991, but lost its rights after the 2020 season due to being outbid by Sky Sport.[297] Despite no longer holding the rights themselves, RTL has broadcast selected sessions on free-to-air television and its streaming service RTL+ as part of various sublicensing agreements with Sky Sport.[298]\nIn France, Formula One is currently broadcast by pay TV channel Canal+, having renewed its broadcasting rights until 2024.[299]\nDistinction between Formula One and World Championship races[edit]\nCurrently, the terms \"Formula One race\" and \"World Championship race\" are effectively synonymous. Since 1984, every Formula One race has counted towards the World Championship, and every World Championship race has been run to Formula One regulations. However, the two terms are not interchangeable.\nThe first Formula One race was held in 1946,[300] whereas the World Championship did not start until 1950.[300]\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, there were many Formula One races that did not count for the World Championship;[301] in 1950, a total of twenty-two Formula One races were held, of which only six counted towards the World Championship.[300] The number of non-championship Formula One events decreased throughout the 1970s and 1980s, to the point where the last non-championship Formula One race was the 1983 Race of Champions.[301]\nThe World Championship was not always exclusively composed of Formula One events:\nThe World Championship was originally established as the \"World Championship for Drivers\", i.e. without the term \"Formula One\" in the title. It only officially became the FIA Formula One World Championship in 1981.\nFrom 1950 to 1960, the Indianapolis 500 race counted towards the World Championship.[301] This race was run to American Automobile Association, and later United States Automobile Club, Championship Car regulations, rather than to Formula One regulations. Only one of the World Championship regulars, Alberto Ascari in 1952, started at Indianapolis during this period.[302]\nFrom 1952 to 1953, all races counting towards the World Championship (except the Indianapolis 500) were run to Formula Two regulations.[301] Formula One was not changed to Formula Two during this period; the Formula One regulations remained the same, and numerous non-championship Formula One races were staged during this time.[303][304]\nThe distinction is most relevant when considering career summaries and all-time lists. For example, in the List of Formula One drivers, Clemente Biondetti is shown with a single race against his name. Biondetti actually competed in four Formula One races in 1950,[305] but only one of these counted for the World Championship.\nIn the earlier history of Formula One, many races took place outside the World Championship, and local championships run to Formula One regulations also occurred. These events often took place on circuits that were not always suitable for the World Championship and featured local cars and drivers as well as those competing in the championship.[16]\nEuropean non-championship racing[edit]\nIn the early years of Formula One, before the world championship was established, there were around twenty races held from late Spring to early Autumn in Europe, although not all of these were considered significant. Most competitive cars came from Italy, particularly Alfa Romeo. After the start of the world championship, these non-championship races continued. In the 1950s and 1960s, there were many Formula One races which did not count for the World Championship; in 1950 a total of twenty-two Formula One races were held, of which only six counted towards the World Championship.[300] In 1952 and 1953, when the world championship was run to Formula Two regulations, non-championship events were the only Formula One races that took place.\nSome races, particularly in the UK, including the Race of Champions, Oulton Park International Gold Cup and the International Trophy, were attended by the majority of the world championship contenders. Other smaller events were regularly held in locations not part of the championship, such as the Syracuse and Danish Grands Prix, although these only attracted a small amount of the championship teams and relied on private entries and lower Formula cars to make up the grid.[16] These became less common through the 1970s and 1983 saw the last non-championship Formula One race; the 1983 Race of Champions at Brands Hatch, won by reigning World Champion Keke Rosberg in a Williams-Cosworth in a close fight with American Danny Sullivan.[16]\nSouth African Formula One championship[edit]\nMain article: South African Formula One Championship\nSouth Africa's domestic Formula One championship ran from 1960 through to 1975. The frontrunning cars in the series were recently retired from the world championship although there were also locally built or modified cars.\nBritish Formula One Championship[edit]\nMain article: British Formula One Championship\nThe DFV helped in making the UK domestic Formula One championship possible between 1978 and 1980. As in South Africa a decade before, second-hand cars from manufacturers like Lotus and Fittipaldi Automotive were the order of the day, although some, such as the March 781, were built specifically for the series. In 1980, the series saw South African Desiré Wilson become the only woman to win a Formula One race when she triumphed at Brands Hatch in a Wolf WR3.[306]\nSee also[edit]\nFormula One portal\nFormula One video games\nGo-kart\nDHL Fastest Lap Award\nDHL Fastest Pit Stop Award\nFIA Pole Trophy\nNotes[edit]\n^ From 2019 to 2024, an additional point was awarded to the car which set the fastest lap, if that car finished inside the top 10.\n^ The event will not be held in 2028 and 2030 under the rotational contract.\n^ a b The Portuguese Grand Prix featured on the 2020 calendar following the cancellation of events due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Figures higher than this are estimated from engine plenum pressure readings.

It is recognised by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), the governing body of international motorsport, as the highest class of competition for open-wheel racing cars. The championship will be contested over several Grands Prix held around the world. Drivers and teams are scheduled to compete for the titles of World Drivers' Champion and World Constructors' Champion, respectively.\nThe 2026 season will feature a major set of regulation changes with a revised power unit configuration and new active aerodynamics. Audi, who acquired Sauber in 2024, will enter as a works team with its own power unit, while Cadillac is set to make its series debut using Ferrari power units, marking the first time an eleventh team has competed since 2016. Honda, through its Honda Racing Corporation subsidiary, will enter into an exclusive works team agreement with Aston Martin, and will supply them with their own power unit after ending its current relationship with Red Bull Racing. Ford will return to the sport for the first time since 2004, supporting Red Bull Powertrains in supplying Red Bull Racing and Racing Bulls. Renault will no longer be an engine supplier as Alpine will switch to Mercedes power units.\nEntries\nEach team is required to enter at least two drivers, one for each of the two mandatory cars.[1] All teams are due to compete with tyres supplied by Pirelli.[2]\nTeams and drivers that are contracted to compete in the 2026 World Championship\nEntrant\nConstructor\nPower unit\nRace drivers\nNo.\nDriver name\nBWT Alpine F1 Team[3]\nAlpine-Mercedes\nMercedes[4][5]\n10\nPierre Gasly[6]\nTBC\nTBA\nAston Martin Aramco Honda[7]\nAston Martin Aramco-Honda\nHonda[8]\n14\nFernando Alonso[9]\n18\nLance Stroll[10]\nRevolut Audi F1 Team[11][12][13]\nAudi\nAudi[11]\n5\nGabriel Bortoleto[14]\n27\nNico Hülkenberg[15]\nCadillac Formula 1 Team[16][17][18]\nCadillac-Ferrari\nFerrari[19]\nTBC\nTBA\nTBC\nTBA\nScuderia Ferrari HP[20]\nFerrari\nFerrari[21]\n16\nCharles Leclerc[22]\n44\nLewis Hamilton[23]\nMoneyGram Haas F1 Team[24]\nHaas-Ferrari\nFerrari[25][26]\n31\nEsteban Ocon[27]\n87\nOliver Bearman[28]\nMcLaren Formula 1 Team\nMcLaren-Mercedes\nMercedes[29]\n4\nLando Norris[30]\n81\nOscar Piastri[31]\nMercedes-AMG Petronas F1 Team[32]\nMercedes\nMercedes[21]\nTBC\nTBA\nTBC\nTBA\nVisa Cash App Racing Bulls F1 Team[33]\nRacing Bulls-Red Bull Ford\nRed Bull Ford[34]\nTBC\nTBA\nTBC\nTBA\nOracle Red Bull Racing[35]\nRed Bull Racing-Red Bull Ford\nRed Bull Ford[34]\n33\nMax Verstappen[36]\nTBC\nTBA\nAtlassian Williams Racing[37]\nWilliams-Mercedes\nMercedes[38]\n23\nAlexander Albon[39]\n55\nCarlos Sainz Jr.[40]\nSource:[41]\nTeam changes\nAudi and Cadillac (logo not shown) will enter Formula One for the first time, while Ford will return for the first time since 2004. Honda will return as an independent engine supplier for the first time since 2021.\nCadillac will become the eleventh team in Formula One, marking Cadillac's first appearance in the series and the first new team on the grid since Haas in 2016. The team will use Ferrari power units and gearboxes,[16][17][18][19] with plans to develop their own engine for use in a future season. Cadillac had previously tried to enter Formula One in conjunction with Andretti Global.[42][43]\nThree new engine manufacturers will enter Formula One, coinciding with the engine regulation changes. Audi will enter the sport for the first time, having purchased the existing Sauber team in 2024. Audi's predecessor company Auto Union did however compete in Grand Prix racing prior to World War II and the inception of the World Championship in 1950.[44] The team raced in the 2024 and 2025 seasons as Kick Sauber, using Ferrari engines, before becoming the Audi factory team in 2026.  As a result, Haas and new entrant Cadillac will become the two Ferrari customer teams.[11][45]\nFord will return to Formula One as an engine supplier for the first time since it provided engines for its own works team Jaguar and its former customers Jordan and Minardi in 2004.[46] It will form a partnership with Red Bull Powertrains, which will supply Red Bull Racing and their second team Racing Bulls. Honda, which partially withdrew from Formula One in 2021 whilst remaining as partners of Red Bull Powertrains, will split from the two Red Bull-owned teams and relaunch a fully-independent engine program starting with Aston Martin under the Honda Racing Corporation subsidiary. Aston Martin had used Mercedes power units since they rejoined the sport, with Mercedes having supplied engines to Aston Martin's predecessors since 2009. Honda had previously collaborated with Aston Martin's predecessor Jordan from 1998 to 2002.[8][34][47]\nRenault will cease to provide engines for Alpine from 2026 onwards after achieving poor results since the beginning of the hybrid power unit regulations in 2014. It will thus be the first season without any Renault engine since the 2000 championship. Alpine will become a customer team as opposed to a full works outfit as had been the case since Renault reacquired Team Enstone ahead of the 2016 season.[4] Alpine will become a customer team of Mercedes, utilising their engines and gearboxes from this season onwards.[5]\nCalendar\nNations that are scheduled to host a Grand Prix in 2026 are highlighted in green, with circuit locations marked with a black dot. Former host nations are shown in dark grey, and former host circuits are marked with a white dot.\nThe 2026 calendar comprises twenty-four Grands Prix, as with the previous two seasons.[48] The Dutch Grand Prix, along with other five races to be selected, will feature the sprint format.[49]\nRound\nGrand Prix\nCircuit\nRace date\n1\nAustralian Grand Prix\nAlbert Park Circuit, Melbourne\n8 March\n2\nChinese Grand Prix\nShanghai International Circuit, Shanghai\n15 March\n3\nJapanese Grand Prix\nSuzuka Circuit, Suzuka\n29 March\n4\nBahrain Grand Prix\nBahrain International Circuit, Sakhir\n12 April\n5\nSaudi Arabian Grand Prix\nJeddah Corniche Circuit, Jeddah\n19 April\n6\nMiami Grand Prix\nMiami International Autodrome, Miami Gardens, Florida\n3 May\n7\nCanadian Grand Prix\nCircuit Gilles Villeneuve, Montreal\n24 May\n8\nMonaco Grand Prix\nCircuit de Monaco, Monaco\n7 June\n9\nBarcelona-Catalunya Grand Prix\nCircuit de Barcelona-Catalunya, Montmeló\n14 June\n10\nAustrian Grand Prix\nRed Bull Ring, Spielberg\n28 June\n11\nBritish Grand Prix\nSilverstone Circuit, Silverstone\n5 July\n12\nBelgian Grand Prix\nCircuit de Spa-Francorchamps, Stavelot\n19 July\n13\nHungarian Grand Prix\nHungaroring, Mogyoród\n26 July\n14\nDutch Grand Prix\nCircuit Zandvoort, Zandvoort\n23 August\n15\nItalian Grand Prix\nMonza Circuit, Monza\n6 September\n16\nSpanish Grand Prix\nMadring, Madrid\n13 September\n17\nAzerbaijan Grand Prix\nBaku City Circuit, Baku\n26 September[a][b]\n18\nSingapore Grand Prix\nMarina Bay Street Circuit, Singapore\n11 October\n19\nUnited States Grand Prix\nCircuit of the Americas, Austin, Texas\n25 October\n20\nMexico City Grand Prix\nAutódromo Hermanos Rodríguez, Mexico City\n1 November\n21\nSão Paulo Grand Prix\nInterlagos Circuit, São Paulo\n8 November\n22\nLas Vegas Grand Prix\nLas Vegas Strip Circuit, Paradise, Nevada\n21 November[a]\n23\nQatar Grand Prix\nLusail International Circuit, Lusail\n29 November\n24\nAbu Dhabi Grand Prix\nYas Marina Circuit, Abu Dhabi\n6 December\nSource:[48]\nCalendar changes\nThe Spanish Grand Prix will move from the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya in Montmeló to a new street circuit in Madrid built around the IFEMA.[51] The Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya will continue to host a race under the name \"Barcelona-Catalunya Grand Prix\".[52] The Dutch Grand Prix will feature the sprint format for the first time after the organisers announced that 2026 would be the final time that the Grand Prix would be held.[49] The Emilia Romagna Grand Prix in Imola was discontinued after their contract to host their race until 2025 was not renewed.[48] The Azerbaijan Grand Prix will be held on a Saturday following a request from the promoter and relevant government stakeholders to accommodate their Remembrance Day.[50][53]\nTeams will have the opportunity to run their cars in a series of three separate three-day tests, a significant expansion over previous testing programs to account for the new chassis and engine regulations.[54]\nRegulation changes\nPower unit, aerodynamic, geometric, and safety regulations are all set to be altered for the 2026 season.[55]\nPower units\nNew power unit regulations are due to be introduced for the 2026 season.[56][57] The new power units will still produce over 1,000 bhp (750 kW), although the power will come from different sources. The engine regulations will see the turbocharged 1.6-litre V6 internal combustion engine configuration used since 2014 retained. However, the MGU-H (Motor Generator Unit – Heat), which has also been in use since 2014, will be banned, while the MGU-K (Motor Generator Unit – Kinetic) output will increase to 470 bhp (350 kW) from 160 bhp (120 kW). The power output of the internal combustion part of the power unit will decrease to 540 bhp (400 kW) from 850 bhp (630 kW). In addition, fuel flow rates will be measured and limited based on energy, rather than mass of the fuel itself. The power units will use a fully sustainable fuel being developed by Formula One.[58][59] The power units are expected to recover twice as much electrical energy as before.[60] During the Commission meeting in early 2025, it was agreed to explore for catch-up options for power unit development for manufacturers who may have fallen behind their competitors in the initial development phase. The Commission also suggested that a relevant advisory committee look at whether the energy deployment of new power units should be reduced in race trim from the planned 470 bhp (350 kW) after some teams became concerned about the possibility of their cars running out of deployable energy in a race.[61]\nCar size and aerodynamics\nOn 6 June 2024, the 2026 car concept was revealed. The concept featured new active aerodynamics in both the front and rear wings. The concept saw the elimination of the drag reduction system, being replaced by a new manual override engine mode.[62] The wheelbase was reduced from 360 cm (140 in) to 340 cm (130 in), the width was reduced from 200 cm (79 in) to 190 cm (75 in), and the minimum mass was reduced by 30 kg (66 lb). The tyres' widths will also be reduced by 2.5 cm (0.98 in) on the front pair and by 3.0 cm (1.2 in) on the rears.[60][63] The floor will have reduced ground effect to ease the issues cars have suffered with porpoising.[64]\nIn October 2024, FIA announced that the downforce reduction of the 2026 cars compared to the 2022–2025 generation of cars would be less than initially proposed for performance and safety reasons.[65] Later in the month, the FIA confirmed that the reduction in downforce from the 2026 generation of cars would be around 15%, a significantly smaller reduction than the originally drafted regulations which the FIA claimed had given the 2026 cars downforce reduction of over 40% compared to their predecessors. In terms of lap time difference this will make the 2026 cars two seconds slower than the 2022–2025 generation of cars rather than the four seconds slower initially envisaged in the initial draft of the 2026 technical regulations.[66]\nSafety features\nThe regulations for the Front Impact Structure (FIS) will be updated with the intent to enhance safety during crashes. A two-stage FIS design has been introduced to address previous issues where the structure detached near the survival cell after a primary collision, leaving the vehicle vulnerable to further impacts. Side intrusion protection, particularly around the cockpit and fuel cell will also be improved. These upgrades aim to shield critical areas of the car during side collisions, while maintaining the vehicle's weight. The roll hoop's strength will be improved, withstanding loads increased from 16G to 20G, aligning with safety standards of other single-seater series. The load testing requirements will be raised from 141 kN to 167 kN.[67]\nTo further safeguard drivers and track marshals, lateral safety lights will be mandated. These lights will display the Energy Recovery System (ERS) status of a car when it stops on track, providing visual indicators of potential electrical risks, especially in emergency situations.[67]\nSeason summary\nPre-season\nThree pre-season tests will be held; the first will be a private test and will take place at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya on 26–30 January, while the second will be held at the Bahrain International Circuit on 11–13 February. The last will be held on the same track on 18–20 February.[50]\nNotes\n^ a b Saturday race.\n^ The Azerbaijan Grand Prix was originally to take place on 27 September before being moved to the day before following a request from the promoter and relevant government stakeholders to accommodate their Remembrance Day.[48][50]\nReferences\n^ \"2026 Formula One Sporting Regulations – Issue 2\" (PDF).

Teams compete in a series of Grand Prix races, held in different countries around the world. Some of the most popular races are held in Monaco, Singapore, Italy and Britain. The Formula One cars are very fast, they reach speeds of up to 351.7 km/ hour (218.5 mph). The championship has been won by many different teams, including McLaren, Ferrari and Williams. Teams can have as many as 600 people. The teams all come together every race weekend. They use the expertise of each member try to win the race. The winning driver and team each get twenty-five points towards the Drivers' and Constructors' Championship. Teams consist of drivers, test drivers, a team principal, mechanics, engineers, and designers. Winning a race is affected by a good starting position, strategy, skill in pitstops and a fast car. The person with the most pole positions (fastest time set in qualifying) during a season gets a trophy. This was added in 2014. One of the longest tracks raced on was the Nürburgring, which is not used anymore.\nThe body that runs Formula One, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA),[1] is based in France. Although Formula One is a 'billion dollar business', a drop in viewership and attendance figures at races has caused the FIA to make rule changes in recent years. These changes are meant to make the races more interesting, so more people watch F1 on television.\nMichael Schumacher in the 2004 Grand Prix in a Ferrari formula one car.\nSafety[change | change source]\nDrivers are paid large salaries to risk their lives every time they drive an F1 car. Like all types of motor racing, the dangers with Formula One are great. Because of this, there are many safety measures. Drivers wear 4 layers of flameproof overalls. They are made of a fire resistant material called Nomex. A drivers helmet must be able to resist an 800 °C flame for at least 45 seconds. They must also resist high G-forces. The helmets are very strong as well, even being able to withstand a truck driving over it.\nCars[change | change source]\nCarbon fibre is the ideal material for the body of Formula One cars, because it is light and strong. Because of this, the cars are very expensive to build and repair. The design of cars differs from team to team. Each team has two entries into the championship. This means that each team must build and maintain two cars . F1 currently uses Pirelli tires (5 compounds of slick tyres and 2 compounds of non-slick tyres for wet weather) Differing weather conditions need different tires. Wet weather driving is considered a skill in Formula One.\nIn 2021, The specifications of an F1 car is 786kg minimum weight, 18 inch wheels and tires.[2] Engines must be 1.6L V6 turbo hybrid intercooled and must reach higher than 3000rpm.[3] The engine must be 4 stroke (Intake, Compression, Combustion and exhaust) and have a 90 degree angle between the V shape.\nRelated pages[change | change source]\nFormula One racing\nList of Formula One broadcasters\nReferences[change | change source]\n↑ \"2024 FIA Formula One World Championship\".

The F1 World Championship season consists of a series of races, known as Grands Prix, held usually on purpose-built circuits, and in a few cases on closed city streets.[2] The results of each race are combined to determine two annual World Championships, one for drivers and one for constructors.\nFerrari hold the record for the most Grand Prix victories, having won 248 times. McLaren are second with 200 wins, and Mercedes are third with 130 wins.[3] Nine countries have produced winning constructors; apart from the six countries which are regarded as the major competitors (France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States), Canada (Wolf), Ireland (Jordan), and Austria (Red Bull) have constructors that have won races despite not having a large automotive industry, with all three teams being based in the UK.\nBritish constructors have won the most Grands Prix, with 16 constructors having won 536 races between them. Italian constructors are second with 270 wins between six constructors. German constructors are third, having won 132 Grands Prix between three constructors. During the first four championship seasons (1950–1953), only Italian constructors won championship races, with the exception of the Indianapolis 500. Five seasons (1973, 1986, 1991, 1992, and 1993) witnessed wins by only British constructors. Since the first win for a British constructor in 1957, British constructors won races in every season until 2013, except 2006.[citation needed] Only one constructor (Benetton) has achieved victories under two different nationalities.\nBy constructor[edit]\nAll figures correct as of the 2025 Hungarian Grand Prix\nNote: All wins were achieved by works teams except for 20 races won by three
